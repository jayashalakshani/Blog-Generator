# Using Hugging Face API for Blog Generation with Streamlit and ngrok
## Objective
The goal of the provided code is to build a simple blog generation tool using a language model from Hugging Face (Llama-2) and integrate it with Streamlit to allow a user-friendly web interface. The project leverages Hugging Face’s API for text generation and ngrok for making the local Streamlit app accessible via a public URL.

## Technologies Used
1. Hugging Face Transformers API (Llama-2 model) for text generation.
2. Langchain for prompt templating and interaction with models.
3. Streamlit for building the web app interface.
4. ngrok to expose the local Streamlit app to the internet.
5. Python (with libraries like subprocess, threading, and os).

## Explanation of Key Components
1. Hugging Face API Integration
In this project, we use the Hugging Face API to interact with the Llama-2 language model. Hugging Face provides a platform for hosting and accessing various pre-trained models, including models for natural language generation (such as the Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML model used here).

Model Used: TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML — This is a powerful language model capable of generating human-like text based on the prompt it receives.
API Token: Hugging Face requires an API token for authentication to access the hosted models. This token can be generated by signing up for an account at Hugging Face and retrieving the token from your profile settings.

### How Hugging Face API Works in the Code
The token is set in the environment using os.environ to ensure that the API can authenticate the request to Hugging Face.
The model repository TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML is used in combination with the Langchain library to handle the text generation based on the prompt.
Langchain's CTransformers is used to interface with Hugging Face models and send requests to generate blog content. The model generates responses based on the prompt provided by the user in the Streamlit web interface.

2. Prompt Templating with Langchain
We use Langchain’s PromptTemplate class to define a structured prompt that the model will respond to. This prompt specifies the job profile, the blog topic, and the number of words, all of which are inputs provided by the user via the Streamlit interface.

In this template:

input_text is the blog title/topic.
no_words specifies the word count for the blog.
blog_style is the type of writing style (for researchers, data scientists, or common people).
This formatted prompt is then passed to the Llama-2 model, which generates a blog post according to the instructions.

3. Streamlit Interface for User Input
Streamlit is used to build the front-end interface for this application. It allows users to input the blog title, select the desired writing style, and specify the number of words.

When the user clicks the “Generate” button, it triggers the model to generate a response using the Hugging Face model and displays the result on the page.

4. Running Streamlit with ngrok
The application runs locally using Streamlit, but to make it accessible to anyone on the internet, we use ngrok. Ngrok creates a secure tunnel from a public URL to the local application running on your machine.

Here’s how ngrok is integrated:

ngrok Auth Token: To use ngrok, you need to create an account on the ngrok website, where you'll be given an authentication token. This token is used to set up the tunnel securely.
The ngrok URL is printed in the console, which can be shared with others to access the Streamlit app from anywhere.

## How to Get Your Hugging Face and ngrok Tokens
### Hugging Face Token
1. Go to Hugging Face.
2. Sign in to your account (or create a new account).
3. Navigate to your profile settings.
4. Under "Access Tokens," create a new token and copy it.
5. Replace YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN in the code with your actual token.
   
## ngrok Token
### Go to ngrok.
1. Sign up for an account.
2. Once signed in, you’ll find your auth token in your dashboard.
3. Copy the token and replace YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN in the code.
